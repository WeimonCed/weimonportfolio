  <h2>    How I see Myself</h2>
  <p>I see muself as a happy and positive person, despite of some difficulties I will always see the ligth in the dark, though i overthink much about myself, I always pray to god that he will guide me through out my career in life
    because I will lend myself to him.
  my greatest strenght will be my confidence, though sometimes I doubt in myself, but I will always be ready to pick myself up even though I am scattered into a Million pieces, I will never give up on myself and my journey cause I know many people are counting on me.
  My weaknesses will be my heart I am a soft hearted person, every little things that hurt me I will take that seriously and it will bare with me for days, though I always try to use the word "Man up" it doesn't work for me, I am very secretive about how I feel towards other people, 
  I express more on what I feel whenever I am alone.
  I am glad that I have a lot of people who is counting on me, specially in the times when I needed opinion of other people to understand more about my self.

  <h2>    Platform Choice</h2>
  <p>I chose this platform caue i want to provemy self that I am capable of learning language and creating a system, website and design it just by learning it, Also since I am an IT student I am practicing myself for our subjects
    in 2nd year whch includes an HTML/CSS learning thats why for me this is the best choice of platform I picked. I can already improve my skills and slso finish the project that my teacher gave.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   
    <p>In making this project I realized many things, About how far of a IT i am. I never expected to see myself working of codes from Time to time. I relfected my life so many times
      also thanks to this project I be able to know myself more and explore yself and leave to my comfort zone, I also realize that I need to be more aware of my past for beable to improe myself towards the future.
      This project help me realize that what I needed in my life is not just myelf but other people too, Physical self, Social self, Spiritul self, Digital self and Future self are once that we need to prioritize to be.
      Having these traits to apply to people will obtain a good connection with your friends and will lift up people around you. Thats why the "self" is the most powerful weapon you have in this world, you can modify it aspect by aspect but you can never change it
      It can never be erased nor it can never be forgotten. that’swhy we should be a better example to the people around us. as one of the famous philosopher once said "know thyself" explore your self and improve it like there is no tommorow
   
   
   
   if you have any insights, Please let me know. Goodluck  </p>
